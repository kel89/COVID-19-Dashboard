# COVID-19-Dashboard
This dasbhoard shows the JHU COVID-19 Data. They have their own fantastic dashboard, however I decided to build my own because they focus on Confirmed Cases, where I think a more interesting number is Active Cases. While their focus seems to be on maps, I have a trend focus. 

## Setup
This does not use any fancy packages, just a recent version of Flask and Pandas. All front end libraries come from CDN's. The data is a bit tricky. This must be in a directory *adjacent to* the [JHU COVID-19 data repo](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). This is in pretty rough shape at the moment, but I plan on hosting it on my local pi and will distribute a link.
